        <h1> Introductory Questions - Madeleine Yeung</h1>
   <p> 1. My name is Madeleine Yeung, and I am a sophomore studying finance.
</p>
</p>
2. I'm from New Jersey (but love to say I'm really from NYC) and am pursuing a minor in HCI because I'm fascinated by UI/UX design!
</p>
</p>
3. I am a complete beginner with HTML/CSS/JS, as I have only taken a brief class during early high school.
</p>
<p>
    4. I really want to learn the fundamentals of HTML/CSS so that I can eventually code my own website!
</p>
</p>
5. Designing for the screen will be more about the technical, interactive aspects (i.e. How easy it for users to scroll? To zoom in?) rather than on paper.

I think the website <a href="https://www.orangeyouglad.com/">OrangeYouGlad</a> showcases effective design. Given that they work as a design agency specializing in UI/UX, website illustration, and branding, it
makes sense to why their website is not only easy to use but also incredibly creative! The website utilizies a lot of saturated, bright colors while still maintaining
a consistent color palette, thus creating a lively yet cohesive experience. Additionally, the website incorporates a lot of fun interactive elements (i.e. the moving "HOWDY" hover state near the bottom)
and cute graphics that work well in establishing OrangeYouGlad's signature style. Most of all, the website's design is easy to navigate, as it emphasizes which features
are clickable and maintains a high sense of contrast through its clear, sans-serif font against a simple background.

I think <a href="https://drinkolipop.com/ ">OLIPOP's</a> website exemplifies effective communication, as it clearly explains what exactly OLIPOP is immediately on the homepage. 
Additionally, the website utilizes many product images and videos that showcase Olipop's extensive range of flavors, but also the refreshing, fizzy taste of 
the soda! By utilizing images solely focused on their products/soda, the website clearly communicates that OLIPOP is all about bringing a new kind of soda to the market.

I love the <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/">Crumbl</a> website, not only because I enjoy their cookies, but I think the website exhibits both great design and communication elements. The website uses
 a very consistent color palette, with its iconic pink color used as the navigation bar and footer. Additionally, the large images of cookies helps consumers
  clearly envision what exactly the different flavors look/taste like. These images also have a sense of repetition, as the page alternates between having
   them on the left and right. By highlighting their weekly flavors on the home page, Crumbl effectively communicates their current products and allows users
    to easily browse through their new flavors.
