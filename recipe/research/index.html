    <h1>Tiramisu</h1>

<p>Tiramisu has always been my absolute favorite cake. Ever since I was ten, I have eaten it for my birthday!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese ,room temperature</li>
    <li> 1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 cups cold espresso , prepared</li>
    <li> 3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur ,optional (Kahlua or DaVinci brands)</li>
    <li> 1 package Lady Fingers ,Savoiardi brand can be found in the cookie aisle at your local grocery store, or online</li>
    <li> Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </li>
    <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
    <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li></ol>

<h2>Recipe Websites That I Like</h2>
<p><a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/easy-tiramisu/">Tastes Better From Scratch</a> is the website I will be using as my reference. I chose this website because
it has very clear-cut instructions and ingredients listed out on the page. Additionally, the website uses incredibly legible typography and a cohesive color palette. I especially 
appreciate the website's large images showcasing not only the final product, but the ingredients required to start baking!</p>
<p><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/tiramisu/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> is a great example example of a baking website that utilizes a really nice color palette. I love the pastel blues, oranges, and pinks, as to me,
 they represent the idea of baking well! I also really love how the website uses cute icons in their navigation bar, as it's an adorable way to represent the different webpages clearly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/roasted-broccoli/">Love and Lemons</a> is another well-formatted recipe website! It uses a very dinstinctive serif font for its titles and body text, as well as creative decorations for the headers. One thing I also really enjoyed was the option for users to 
directly add the website's photos to a Pinterest Board; when users hover over an image, they are shown  
the words, "PIN IT," which takes them directly to Pinterest!</p>

<h2>Non-Recipe Websites That I Like</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://us.jellycat.com/">Jellycat</a> website perfectly encapsulates the cute, comfortable image of the brand. It uses images that 
evoke a sense of playfulness, and keeps the background of its products/stuffed animals white so that they pop out well.
 Most of all, it uses an aqua color for its accents, making it clear to users what things are interactive and what are not.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moooi.com/us">moooi</a> website does an effective job at being simple, but creative with its design. It utilizes a minimalistic approach, with neutral colors
 and sufficient negative space. I especially liked how the home page has its images take up the entire width of the screen, as it showcases the products clearly.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a> website establishes hierarchy efficiently through its difference in text types. For instance, it uses bold, large font to show what is a title/subtitle, and 
maintains a consistent style for its images, as most are justified to the right.</p>
